```

Three ideas carry the whole design:

1. **Postgres is the system of record; the engine holds no copy of any table.** The engine keeps
   per-shape routing metadata and shared subquery inner-sets only; shape backfills and membership
   query-backs read just the matching rows from Postgres (pooled, parallel). The circuit's counts
   pipelines (§6b) are *derived*, in-memory, reseed-on-boot state — never the record of truth.
2. **Everything between layers is an append-only stream.** The write path (replication → table
   streams) and the read path (shape streams → clients) never talk directly; the engine is a
   restartable consumer in the middle.
3. **Every maintained result is de-duplicated.** Two equal shapes — same table, canonical predicate,
   projection, and kind — share one maintained stream, ref-counted. Identical subqueries share one
   inner-set node. Identical aggregations share one running fold. The engine maintains and appends
   once for all subscribers.

---

## 1. Components

- **durable-streams** — append-only, offset-addressed JSON streams with long-poll tailing. One
  `changes` stream for all tables (the write log; the envelope's `type` carries the table name),
  one `shape/<id>` stream per distinct shape (the
  result feed). The decoupling boundary between write and read paths.
- **engine** (`apps/engine`, Rust) — the core: replication ingest, per-change Z-set deltas, fan-out to
  shapes/subqueries/aggregations, the control-plane HTTP API, and the Electric-compatible
  `GET /v1/shape` endpoint.
- **API** (`apps/api`, tRPC) — the extended surface used by `@electric-circuits/client`: `schema.define`,
  `ingest.write` (library mode), `shapes.create/get/delete`, `subset.query/live`, `aggregate`.
- **client** (`packages/client`) — `shape()` (a live TanStack DB collection), `subset()` (an ordered,
  windowed page + a shared live tail), `aggregate()` (a live scalar), typed writes, `awaitTxId`.
- **oracle + conformance** (`packages/oracle`, `packages/conformance`) — a Postgres/pglite reference
  implementation and the harness asserting engine ≡ oracle for the same op stream, through the real
  API + client, including live replication, fuzzing, NULLs, and concurrent writers.

---

## 2. Data model

- **`Value`** (`value.rs`) — `Int | Float | Text | Bool | Null`. NULL is first-class (three-valued
  logic). **`Row`** = positional `Vec<Value>`; the schema names the positions.
- **Z-set delta** — `Vec<Tup2<Row, ZWeight>>`, `ZWeight` a signed i64: insert = `(row,+1)`, delete =
  `(old,−1)`, update = `(old,−1),(new,+1)`. `old` comes from the replication envelope
  (`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`), so no local table state is needed to retract a row. The delta algebra
  is [`dbsp`](https://crates.io/crates/dbsp)'s — `Tup2` and `ZWeight` are dbsp's own, and
  `Value`/`Row` carry the `DBData` derive stack. Routing- and fallback-tier shapes are evaluated
  by plain Rust (key routing + stateless predicate evaluation; internals doc §1); the circuit
  tier (§6b) maintains the counts pipelines and the membership circuit's contributor relation,
  serving decomposable COUNT aggregates and the subquery registry's inner-set state (the
  per-feed delete gate lives host-side, `subq_feed.rs`). Row arrangements no longer exist —
  row data lives in Postgres.
- **Envelope** (`ds.rs`) — the unit on every stream:
  `{ type, key, value, old, headers{ operation, txid, offset, lsn, seq } }`. The ingestor stamps
  `lsn` (transaction **commit** LSN), `txid` (the Postgres **xid**), and `seq` (the change's position
  within its transaction).

---

## 3. Ingest: logical replication, exactly-once effect

`replication.rs` **streams** a `pgoutput` slot over the walsender protocol (push delivery — no
poll floor; the wire client is `pgwire-replication`, the message decoding is our `pgoutput.rs`).
Each transaction's changes are buffered between `Begin` and `Commit`, stamped with
`(commit LSN, xid, seq)`, appended to `changes`, and only **then** acknowledged to Postgres
(`confirmed_flush_lsn`) — a failed append tears the connection down unacknowledged, and the server
resends from the confirmed position.

Delivery to the table streams is therefore **at-least-once** (a partial multi-table append failure,
or acknowledgements not yet flushed at a crash, re-deliver whole transactions). Deltas are *not*
idempotent for aggregates and subquery contributor weights, so the consumer side restores
exactly-once **effect**:

- **Sequencer de-duplication.** `(commit LSN, seq)` uniquely identifies a change and is strictly
  increasing on the single ordered log. The sequencer keeps a highwater mark and skips anything at
  or below it.
- The drain-barrier sentinel (`__el_sync`) is published only after its whole commit landed on the
  streams, so the barrier can never claim "drained" while a transaction is still due for re-append.

Degraded/unsupported forms are **loud, never silent**: an `UPDATE` without an old image or a `DELETE`
without tuple data (REPLICA IDENTITY no longer FULL) and `TRUNCATE` log errors describing the staleness
they cause; unparseable values (e.g. `NaN` floats) log errors when degraded to NULL.

---

## 4. Backfill and the consistency fence (SnapshotGate)

A shape's initial rows come from a single `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot with the predicate pushed into
the `SELECT`. Live and backfill must then be reconciled so every change counts exactly once.

**LSN comparison alone is not sound.** `pg_current_wal_lsn()` is a WAL *write* position, but snapshot
visibility is decided later, at `ProcArrayEndTransaction` (after the commit record is fsynced). A
transaction whose commit record is already in the WAL can be **invisible** to a snapshot taken during
that window — skipping its replicated change "because commit LSN < seed LSN" would drop the row from
both the backfill and the live stream, permanently. Conversely, a visible commit can sit exactly at
the boundary and be replayed as a duplicate.

The fence is therefore **transaction visibility** (`pg::SnapshotGate`): the backfill transaction
captures `pg_current_snapshot()` (xmin / xmax / in-progress xids) in the same statement that
establishes the snapshot, and the engine skips a replicated change **iff its xid was visible to that
snapshot** (every xid seen on the slot is committed, so visibility is `xid < xmin`, or
`xmin ≤ xid < xmax` and not in the in-progress list). Changes without a parseable xid (library mode)
fall back to the strict-`<` LSN comparison. Every seeded structure — routed shapes, standalone shapes,
aggregations, subquery nodes, subquery shapes — carries its own gate; `changes_only` feeds carry a
passthrough gate (no backfill ⇒ forward everything).

The backfill row representation is normalized to match the live path: text-mapped columns are read
with `::text` casts so a cell's value is Postgres's *text output* — the same form pgoutput's
text-mode tuples
prints — rather than `to_jsonb`'s (which would make the same timestamp compare unequal between a
backfilled row and its first live update).

*Known residual:* the **client-side subset seam** (§7) still positions by LSN watermarks; the same
visibility window theoretically applies to a subset page's snapshot vs its live tail and would need
the page query-back to also return the snapshot's xid list. Engine-maintained state is fully fenced.

---

## 5. The engine: fan-out, sharing, lifecycle

### 5.1 Sequencer model

ONE tokio task consumes the single ordered change log for all tables — Electric's
`ShapeLogCollector` pattern. Processing is serial in commit order (global ordering and state are
trivially correct), and each source transaction's shape appends are flushed **before the next
transaction is processed** — per-transaction atomic emission, across tables; the only intra-txn
parallelism is the append flush (bounded-concurrent, CAP=32). After a batch is fully fanned out
**and every append has landed**, the sequencer publishes its processed offset — the convergence
barrier used by the conformance harness (`GET /tables/<t>/offset` reports the global offset).

Shape creation is **two-phase** so a Postgres backfill never stalls the pipeline: `BeginShape`
registers a pending shape that buffers its table's deltas; the creator runs the backfill on a
pooled connection concurrently; `ActivateShape` replays the buffer through the shape's snapshot
gate and goes live. The buffer is registered before the snapshot is taken, so no change can fall
between them.

### 5.2 Three execution strategies

The shape of the predicate picks the strategy (full detail + cost model: internals doc §3):

- **Equality templates** (`a = 1 AND b = 2`) → **key routing**: one shared `KeyRouter` per key-column
  set; `key_tuple → {shapes}`. Routing is O(log N), independent of shape count; zero table rows held.
- **Standalone** (ranges, OR, NOT, …) → a stateless three-valued filter evaluated directly on the
  delta. No state. A necessary-conjunct index (`(column, op)` — equality hash buckets + ordered
  range bounds) selects only the candidate shapes per change; predicates with no indexable
  conjunct (OR/NOT/LIKE/`!=` at the top) fall back to a scan list.
- **Subqueries** (`col [NOT] IN (SELECT …)`) → the cross-table registry (§6), for every
  subquery form — the registry is the one membership implementation (row data lives in
  Postgres; see §6b).

**Aggregations** (electric-circuits extension, not part of the Electric-compatible API): a scalar
COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX over a non-subquery predicate, maintained incrementally as a fold over the
delta — COUNT/SUM/AVG hold running scalars, MIN/MAX a `value → net-weight` multiset so retractions
restore the previous extreme. A COUNT whose predicate decomposes over a counts pipeline's group
columns is served from the circuit instead (§6b). SQL NULL semantics are mirrored exactly: aggregates ignore NULL values,
`COUNT(col)` counts non-NULLs (`COUNT(*)` counts rows), AVG divides by the non-NULL count, and
SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX over zero non-NULL values are NULL. The feed carries the current value as a
single-row stream (`{ value, n }`).

### 5.3 Shape de-duplication (the sharing layer)

Any two **equal** shapes share one maintained stream, ref-counted:

- **Signature.** Row shapes: `(table, canonical predicate, sorted projection, changes_only)` —
  predicate canonicalization is order-insensitive (`a AND b` ≡ `b AND a`). Aggregations:
  `(table, canonical predicate, function, column)`, namespaced so the two kinds never collide.
- **Join.** A create whose signature already exists increments the refcount and returns the *same*
  shape id + stream. Joiners **wait for the creator's backfill to land** (a watch channel in the
  share entry) so no caller ever sees a stream whose snapshot isn't readable yet — and a *failed*
  creation propagates to every waiting joiner rather than handing them a dead stream.
- **Drop.** Deletes decrement; the shape, its routing/registry entries, **and its durable stream**
  are torn down when the last subscriber leaves (a dropped shape must not leave an orphaned stream
  on the storage server). N joiners hold the same id and must each delete exactly once; the client
  enforces one-shot `close()`.
- The Electric `/v1/shape` adapter opts out (`share=false`) — its protocol needs per-request handles.

### 5.4 Creation is atomic; failures never leave zombies

`create_shape` returns `Ok` only after registration + backfill actually succeeded. On any failure —
backfill error, subquery seeding error, append error — the shape record, share entries, sequencer
registration, and (for subqueries) every node refcount/edge/pending-seed added by the attempt are
rolled back, waiting joiners get the error, and the stream is deleted. This structurally excludes
the "zombie shape" failure mode: a shape that is registered, streams nothing, and pins its
signature so all future identical creates silently join a dead feed.

### 5.5 Reliability: appends never drop silently

A lost shape-stream append is a permanent divergence for every subscriber, so live-path appends use
`append_reliable`: transient failures retry with capped backoff (backpressuring the sequencer — the same
stance as the ingestor's read-then-commit), and the only non-retried case is 404 (the shape was
dropped mid-flush; discard is correct). Because shape envelopes are absolute per-pk
(`upsert`/`delete` by key), an ambiguous-failure double-append is idempotent for readers.

---

## 6. Subqueries: shared inner-set nodes

(Cost model: internals doc §3.3.)

A predicate leaf `col [NOT] IN (SELECT proj FROM inner WHERE …)` routes through a registry the
sequencer feeds every table's deltas into:

- **Node** — one per distinct inner query (canonical signature), ref-counted. The node's value
  set lives in the **membership circuit** (§6b): the registry asserts each inner row's current
  contribution *absolutely* (`(node_id, pk) → value` / absent) into a dbsp **upsert map**, which
  derives the exact retract/insert deltas internally — there is no host-side reverse index to
  keep in sync. A value is in the set iff its contributor count is positive. (Assertions are
  computed host-side because evaluation can read *other* nodes' sets via nested `IN`.)
- **Templates** — nodes are grouped by parameterized template (`predicate.rs::subquery_template`):
  the inner WHERE's top-level equality literals are lifted out as a **bind**, so `user_id = 1` and
  `user_id = 2` share one compiled residual + parameter projection. A delta on the inner table is
  evaluated **once per template** (one residual eval + one bind hash-lookup per touched pk),
  routed to the single affected node — instead of one full-predicate eval per literal-keyed node.
  Flip detection is the circuit's incremental distinct: the step's output deltas ARE the flips.
- **Edges** — `node → dependent` (an outer shape, or a *parent node* for nested subqueries), labeled
  with the connecting column. When a node **flips** a value (∅→non-empty or back), the dependent rows
  with `connecting_col = value` are queried back and re-evaluated, recursing up the DAG. Flip
  propagation runs on a **semaphore-bounded worker pool** (`ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_FLIP_WORKERS`, default 8),
  off the sequencer hot path: the Postgres query-backs run concurrently (bounded by the shared
  `ELECTRIC_DB_POOL_SIZE` pool) and never hold the registry lock. Membership evaluation and the
  **enqueue** of the resulting envelopes happen atomically under the lock, and each shape stream
  drains through one ordered **emission lane** (`engine/emission.rs`, `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_EMIT_LANES`),
  so per-shape append order equals evaluation order — a stale move can never land after a fresher
  emission — without network under the lock. The engine exposes the in-flight count
  (`GET /replication/lsn` → `pendingFlips`) as the extra convergence-barrier term; it covers both
  undrained flips and enqueued-but-unlanded lane batches.
- **Absolute emission via the per-feed key set** — the correctness rule that keeps deferred
  flips convergent: for each touched pk the registry asserts the row's *current* membership into
  the shape's **feed set** (`subq_feed::FeedSet`, one host-side Roaring bitmap per feed), never a
  history-dependent delta. An `upsert` is delivered for every matching candidate (updates to
  continuing members flow); a `delete` is delivered **only when the check-and-set actually removes**,
  so a "not a member" verdict for a pk the stream never contained is structurally a no-op — the
  never-member spurious delete (the PR #30 wake-storm) cannot be emitted at all. Flip
  propagation runs deferred (out of commit order); absolute assertion converges regardless of
  that timing — which is why the Electric-style LSN-buffering/tag protocol isn't needed here.
- **NULL sensitivity** — SQL: a NULL in the inner set makes `x NOT IN S` UNKNOWN. A NULL flip
  re-derives exactly the dependents that can change: those whose `IN` leaf is negated **or sits under
  any `Not{…}`** (with no negation above the leaf, NULL only moves the leaf between FALSE and
  UNKNOWN, and AND/OR are monotone over FALSE < UNKNOWN < TRUE, so inclusion can't change).
- **Atomicity** — node creation/refcounts/edges roll back exactly on a failed shape create (§5.4).

---

## 6b. The circuit tier: counts pipelines + the membership circuit

The circuit tier is two small dbsp circuits per engine (O(1) — never per shape). **Row data
lives in Postgres, never engine-side.** The counts circuit is fully in-memory; the membership
circuit's contributor relation spills to disk by default (a disposable per-boot cache — see its
bullet). Neither circuit checkpoints: both reseed on boot.

- The **counts circuit** (`arrangements.rs`) maintains the configured counts pipelines
  ((group → count) relations, O(distinct groups)). The sequencer feeds each transaction into it
  and steps it **before** fanning the transaction out, so circuit-served aggregates emit within
  the transaction that changed them.
- The **membership circuit** (`subq_circuit.rs`, owned by the subquery registry, always on)
  holds the CONTRIBUTORS **upsert map** (dbsp `add_input_map`; the operator maintains the map
  and derives exact deltas from absolute assertions): `(node_id, pk_id) → value`, projected to
  `(node_id, value)` weighted by contributor count → `integrate_trace` snapshot (serves
  `contains`/`has_null`/introspection) + `distinct → output` (the step's deltas are the
  membership **flips**, §6). The per-feed key sets — the delete gate — live **host-side**
  (`subq_feed.rs`, one Roaring bitmap per feed over `u32` pk-dictionary ids): a synchronous
  check-and-set under the registry lock, dramatically lighter than the former in-circuit feed
  relation (§6). The registry evaluates templates host-side per envelope, under its lock, and
  awaits the step — intra-transaction ordering is identical to the old in-registry kernel, and
  reads are read-your-writes. Structure is fixed at construction (one generic input);
  registering templates/nodes/binds is pure runtime data — no rebuild, ever. State is
  O(contributing inner rows), bind-gated: only subscribed binds hold state, each seeded from
  Postgres like any backfill. The contributor relation **spills to disk by default** (dbsp's
  storage backend: spine batches page to layer files under a per-boot temp dir with a bounded
  buffer cache; without checkpointing the files are a disposable cache, auto-removed at
  shutdown). `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE=0` keeps it fully in-memory;
  `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE_DIR` pins an explicit location.

- **Counts pipelines** — `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DBSP_COUNTS=table:col+col,…` compiles, per table (at
  most one spec each), a `map_index(group) → weighted_count` pipeline: a live COUNT per
  distinct projection of the group columns.
- **Serving**: COUNT aggregates whose predicate decomposes over a counts pipeline's group
  columns (a conjunction of equalities / IN-lists over group columns only) are seeded by
  summing the matching groups and updated live from each step's group deltas. SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX —
  and COUNTs that don't decompose — use the sequencer's conjunct-indexed incremental fold (§5.2).
- **Boot**: state is in-memory only, so each counts pipeline reseeds on every boot from ONE
  `SELECT <group cols>, count(*) … GROUP BY` per table under a `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot —
  O(groups), not O(rows) — and the seed's `SnapshotGate` (xid visibility) fences change-log
  replay exactly like a shape backfill.
- **Row lookups** (subquery flip re-derivations, full re-derives, membership move-ins) are
  pooled Postgres queries (`engine/membership.rs`) — parallel across the flip-worker pool,
  bounded by `ELECTRIC_DB_POOL_SIZE`. `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DBSP_INDEXES` is **deprecated** and ignored
  (it configured the removed row arrangements).
- **Membership shapes** — including single-level non-negated `col IN (SELECT …)` — are served
  by the subquery registry (§6): two-phase creation (Postgres backfill + gate), shared inner-set
  nodes, flips, absolute emission. There is no separate cohort/arrangement membership tier; its
  reason to exist (local row snapshots) went away with the row arrangements.

### Configuration reference

| variable | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DBSP_COUNTS` | none | counts pipelines: `table:col+col[,…]`; at most one per table. Empty = no circuit. |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_FLIP_WORKERS` | `8` | concurrent flip-propagation workers (Postgres query-backs). |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_EMIT_LANES` | `8` | ordered emission lanes for subquery-shape appends. |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE` | `1` | `0` disables membership-circuit disk spilling (relations stay fully in-memory). |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE_DIR` | per-boot temp dir | explicit spill location (kept on shutdown; the default temp dir is auto-removed). |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_STORAGE_CACHE_MIB` | `64` | storage buffer-cache budget, in MiB, TOTAL (dbsp uses the value verbatim, not multiplied by workers/thread-types). Bounds dbsp's own unset-default, which for this circuit's 1-worker layout would be 512 MiB (256 MiB × 1 worker × 2 thread-types). |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SUBQ_MIN_STORAGE_KB` | `128` | spine batches above this size page to disk. |

(The former `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DBSP_DIR`/`_CACHE_MIB`/`_MIN_STORAGE_KB`/`_MAX_RSS_MB`/
`_CHECKPOINT_SECS`/`_INDEXES` storage knobs are deprecated no-ops: there is no on-disk circuit
state to tune. `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_FEED_TRACE` is likewise removed — the feed relation now lives
host-side (Phase 2), so there is no enumeration copy left to toggle.)

- **Observability**: `/graph` carries an `arrangements` section — the counts pipelines as
  stable-id nodes (`arr:input:<table>`, `arr:counts:<table>`, with seeded flags) plus a
  `consumers` list connecting each counts node to the circuit-served aggregates it feeds.
- **Limits**: a dbsp circuit's structure is fixed at construction, so new **counts specs**
  need a restart (state reseeds from Postgres in O(groups), so a restart is cheap); single
  worker; COUNT only. Subquery templates are NOT structure — the membership circuit's one
  tuple input serves any number of them, registered at runtime.

### The serving model this is one tier of

- **The circuit serves count templates.** Deploy-time counts pipelines, one live count per
  cohort group, never growing with shapes/users/parameter combinations. A COUNT aggregate is a
  selection/sum over those groups.
- **Routing serves query instances.** Equality templates share `KeyRouter` families; standalone
  predicates and aggregates are conjunct-indexed — a change finds its shapes by index lookup,
  never by scan.
- **The registry serves subqueries.** All `[NOT] IN (SELECT …)` shapes: shared inner-set
  nodes grouped as parameterized templates, membership state + flip detection in the
  membership circuit, parallel flip query-backs to Postgres, ordered emission lanes, absolute
  per-pk emission.

---

## 7. Subset queries and client positioning

A **subset query** is the non-materialized counterpart to a shape: one
`SELECT … WHERE … ORDER BY … LIMIT/OFFSET` page against Postgres (subquery predicates evaluated
natively by Postgres) + a **shared** `changes_only` live feed for the base predicate. Ranges live
*only* here — they are never live-tailed, so a change is matched against one base predicate, never
split across ranges. `orderBy`/`limit` are subset knobs, not shape knobs.

The client (`packages/client/src/subset.ts`) merges the page(s) and the live tail by **per-pk LSN
watermarks**: the page's snapshot LSN, and each applied delta's commit LSN. Engine output envelopes
carry their commit LSN for exactly this. Key invariants (all regression-tested):

- The feed is created and its head offset captured **before** the page snapshot, so no delta can fall
  in the gap; overlap reconciles idempotently by pk (`delta lsn ≥ snapshot lsn` applies; the engine's
  backfill-visible side is strictly below).
- **Deletes leave tombstone watermarks** (including for pks never seen): a `loadMore` page whose
  snapshot predates a delete must not resurrect the row / insert a ghost. Tombstones prune when no
  page is in flight.
- Close is one-shot; the feed is deleted with retries; a failed page query-back deletes the
  just-created feed before rethrowing (no refcount pinning).

---

## 8. Electric protocol adapter

`GET /v1/shape` (`electric.rs`) serves the ElectricSQL client protocol directly from the engine:
`table` + SQL `where` (+ `columns`) are parsed (`where_sql.rs`) into the same predicate AST used
everywhere else, identical `/v1/shape` definitions share ONE engine shape (`share=true`, so the
handle is the shared shape id), the shape stream is folded into the Electric message shape
(insert/update/delete + `up-to-date` control messages), and live requests long-poll. Handle state
is evicted after an idle TTL (`ELECTRIC_HANDLE_TTL`); the backing shape + stream are **retained**
and follow the engine's three-tier retention lifecycle (active / dormant / evicted — idle shapes
drop their engine state but keep the stream, and any touch reactivates them by change-log replay
from the captured resume offset (through the sequencer's two-phase pending-buffer handshake);
see `apps/engine/src/retention.rs`). A request with an evicted handle gets `409 must-refetch`,
which the Electric client handles by re-syncing onto the retained shape. Conformance against Electric's own oracle + integration tests lives in
`electric-conformance/` (see its README for scope and known gaps — e.g. row `tags` are not emitted;
absolute membership emission makes them unnecessary for convergence).

## 9. Consistency & durability model (summary)

| seam | mechanism | guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| backfill ↔ live | `SnapshotGate` (xid visibility; LSN fallback) | each change counts exactly once per shape/aggregate/node |
| ingestor → change log | append → acknowledge + `(lsn,seq)` sequencer de-dup | at-least-once delivery, exactly-once effect |
| engine → shape streams | `append_reliable` + offset published only after landing | no silently-lost deltas; barrier implies subscriber streams reflect the batch |
| cross-table subquery order | absolute membership emission + flip query-backs | convergence independent of deferred-flip timing |
| shared shapes | signature + refcount + ready-watch + atomic rollback | joiners see a live, backfilled stream or an error; last drop tears everything down |
| subset page ↔ live tail | per-pk LSN watermarks + delete tombstones | no double-count, no resurrections/ghosts across the seam (LSN-based; see §4 residual) |
| client lifecycle | one-shot close, delete-with-retry | balanced create/drop; no refcount pinning or steal |
| engine restart | durable shape catalog (`meta/catalog`: create/join/leave/drop + change-log offset checkpoints) | plain/routed shapes + aggregates restore without client re-registration (plain resume via replay + passthrough gates; aggregates re-seed with a fresh gate); counts pipelines reseed from a fresh group-aggregated snapshot (§6b); subquery shapes are dropped loudly (inner-node state is not persisted) and recreated by clients |

The invariant the conformance suite asserts end-to-end: *for any shape and any op stream, the
client-materialized set equals the oracle's `SELECT … WHERE <predicate>`* — through the real API,
stream, and client, including live replication, batched mutations, NULLs, and concurrent writers.

## 10. Threading model

| unit | threads | notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| engine main | tokio multi-thread | sequencer + flush run here |
| sequencer (all tables) | 1 task | commit-ordered change processing; per-txn atomic flush |
| shapes (any kind) | **0** | no per-shape thread or circuit |
| replication ingestor | 1 task | stream pgoutput/decode/append/acknowledge |
| subquery registry | 0 (a mutex) | eval + emission-lane enqueue under it (in-memory only; no network under the lock) |
| flip workers | ≤ `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_FLIP_WORKERS` tasks (default 8) | concurrent deferred query-backs; PG round-trips never hold the registry lock |
| emission lanes | `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_EMIT_LANES` tasks (default 8) | per-stream FIFO writers: append order = eval order per shape |
| circuit (counts) | 1 OS thread | owns the `DBSPHandle`; blocking steps, fed by a bounded channel (backpressure to the sequencer) |
| circuit (membership) | 1 OS thread | owns the membership `DBSPHandle`; stepped per envelope by the registry (subquery tables only) |

Threads are flat in the number of shapes *and* in the number of equality templates.

## 11. Telemetry

- `GET /metrics` — atomic counters (`envelopes_processed`, `shape_appends`, `family_steps`) +
  log-bucket latency histograms (`process_envelope`, `family_step`, `append`) with p50/p99/p999/max.
- `GET /memory` + OTel gauges (`engine_shapes`, `engine_subquery_nodes`, `engine_subquery_contributors`,
  `engine_family_circuits`, …) — the cardinalities that drive RSS; `GET /metrics/prometheus` exports.
- `GET /graph`, `GET /graph/node?sig=…`, `GET /shapes/{id}/rows` — the live pipeline topology + node
  indexes + shape contents, consumed by the **pipeline explorer** (`apps/pipeline-viz`).
- `GET /state`, `GET /state/node?id=…` — per-node live state: summaries for every pipeline node
  (offsets, emit counters, routing-index/inner-set cardinalities, fold values) and on-demand deep
  dumps (a family's routing index contents, an aggregate's fold internals incl. the MIN/MAX
  multiset). Summaries are also pushed as `{"type":"state"}` events on `/trace` after each batch,
  which is what makes the explorer's node chips reactive without polling.
- `GET /tables/<t>/families`, `GET /subqueries` — sharing topology (proof that N shapes share one
  router/node).

## 12. Potential speedups

The engine's internal per-change cost stays small even at a large shape count; the end-to-end
ceiling under load is **storage throughput** (the single-process durable-streams test server), not
engine compute.

**Storage / append path (current ceiling)**
1. Multi-stream append (one request, many streams) — fan-out to M streams is M HTTP requests today.
2. HTTP/2 multiplexing / persistent pipelined connections to storage.
3. Shard the sequencer's fan-out (partition a table's shapes/key-space across tasks). (Subquery
   flip propagation is already parallel: worker pool + ordered emission lanes.)
4. ~~A production durable-streams backend (the old Node test server fsynced per append).~~ Done:
   the streams layer is the Rust `durable-streams` server (group-commit WAL; `packages/ds-rust`
   wrapper).

**Standalone evaluation (O(K) per change)**
5. ~~Predicate indexing by `(column, op)` — turn O(K) into output-sensitive.~~ Done: standalone
   shapes are indexed by a necessary conjunct (equality → hash bucket, range bound → ordered
   scan); only candidates are evaluated per change. Un-indexable predicates (OR/NOT/LIKE/`!=`)
   remain on a fallback scan list.
6. Widen the shared class beyond pure equality (e.g. single-column range templates).

**Engine compute / representation**
7. ~~Backfill connection pooling for burst shape creation (the fleet benchmark's p99 driver).~~
   Done: backfills/query-backs/subset queries share a per-URL pool (`ELECTRIC_DB_POOL_SIZE`, default 20).
8. Intern stream paths/txids; pack `Value` (smaller enum, interned strings).

---

## 13. Client query layer (two-level querying)

There are **two query layers** with different jobs:

1. **Server-side shape predicate** — *what crosses the network*. One table + a `WHERE` over its
   columns (+ subqueries), optionally narrowed by a `columns` projection (sync only what a view
   needs; the pk is always included). The engine maintains exactly this set on the shape stream.
2. **Client-side live query** (TanStack DB `useLiveQuery` over the materialized collection) — *how
   it's presented*: ordering, text search, finer filtering. Maintained incrementally on the client;
   a refinement (typing in a search box) never touches the engine or re-syncs.

**Windowed / infinite-scroll sync** uses **subset queries** (§7): each page is a bounded keyset range
query (`col < lastSeen OR (col = lastSeen AND id < lastId)` folded into the `WHERE`), no stateful
top-N anywhere. The render layer is virtualized, so a 100k-row deployment stays a few dozen DOM nodes.
For permissioned/faceted lists, prefer **per-facet feeds reused across filter changes** + a client
merge (identical predicates across users ⇒ shared engine families) over folding UI filters into the
predicate (which recreates the feed per click) — see AGENTS.md "gotchas".
